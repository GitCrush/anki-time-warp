# Anki Time Warp

**Anki Time Warp** is a scheduling assistant for Anki that allows you to "time-warp" your review timelines. It’s designed for learners who want to take control of their study pace, prioritize topics, or manage their review load during unusual periods like holidays or intensive study sessions.
